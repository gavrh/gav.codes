			content="I'm an 19-year-old currently pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science.
      Coding is not just a part of my academic journey but a genuine passion. Outside of the tech world,
      I have a deep love for animals and a strong appreciation for music. While I'm not a musician,
      I find inspiration and relaxation in various genres. I also actively engage in activities
      supporting animal welfare. This combination of technical interest, compassion for animals,
      and love for music shapes my well-rounded approach to life."
