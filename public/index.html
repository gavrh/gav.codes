      content="I'm an 18-year-old currently pursuing a Bachelor's degree in
      Computer Science. Coding is not just a part of my academic
      journey but a genuine passion. Outside of the tech world, I
      have a deep love for animals and a strong appreciation for
      music. While I'm not a musician, I find inspiration and
      relaxation in various genres. I also actively engage in
      activities supporting animal welfare. This combination of
      technical interest, compassion for animals, and love for
      music shapes my well-rounded approach to life."

      Notice the use of %PUBLIC_URL% in the tags above.
      It will be replaced with the URL of the `public` folder during the build.
      Only files inside the `public` folder can be referenced from the HTML.

      Unlike "/favicon.ico" or "favicon.ico", "%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" will
      work correctly both with client-side routing and a non-root public URL.
      Learn how to configure a non-root public URL by running `npm run build`.
